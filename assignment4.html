Assignment 4 

The closest tram stop to the start of the route is the Keizersgracht stop of tramline 4 at only a minute walk away. Tramline 4 has an irregular schedule, but generally a tram to the central station leaves on average every 15 minutes. The trams have a capacity of between 131 and 151 places with a single carriage (over.gvb.nl/tram-in-cijfers). With a frequency of 4 per hour, the tramline can transport between 524 and 604 passengers per hour in both directions. The closest bus stop, the Rembrandtplein bus stop of is a little bit further away at 5 minutes walking, however this bus stop only serves nightbuses and doesnâ€™t have any services during the day. This is also the case for other bus stops around the area of the start.  

For the finish, the closest tram stop is the 1e Coehoornstraat stop of tramline 7 between Azartplein and Sloterpark. This tram station is an 11-minute walk away from the finish area. This line does have a regular schedule, and trams leave in both directions every 10 minutes. As stated before, the capacity of trams used by the GVB is between 131 and 151 passengers per single carriage. So for tramline 7, this means a caring capacity of between 655 and 755 passengers per hour. The closest bus stops to the finish area are the Kattenburgerplein and the Kattenburgerstraat which service the 22 and 43 lines respectively. The 22 line connects to the Sloterdijk train station and the Muiderpoort train station with a frequency of every 10 minutes. The 43 line connects to the Borneo Eiland and the central train station, with a frequency of every 15 minutes. The capacity of the busses used by the GVB is 85 for standard busses and 150 for articulated busses (over.gvb.nl/bus-in-cijfers). For line 22, with a frequency of 5 times per hour, this means a caring capacity of between 425 and 750 per hour. As the frequency of line 43 is lower at 4 per hour, the caring capacity is lower at 340 to 600 passengers per hour.
